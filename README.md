## üåü Overview

BlockShare is a decentralized ledger and blockchain platform designed for running your own cryptocurrency in a local network environment. With a C++ core handling blockchain operations and a JavaScript-based API layer for client interactions, BlockShare provides a functional peer-to-peer network that supports transaction processing, balance management, and digital signature verification.

## üöÄ Key Features

- üåê **Local Cryptocurrency Network**: Launch and manage a cryptocurrency network within a local WiFi environment.
- üîÑ **Peer-to-Peer Node Communication**: Supports decentralized networking for nodes to communicate, process transactions, and maintain data consistency.
- üîí **Secure Transactions**: Handles transaction signing and validation with digital signature verification.
- üõ†Ô∏è **RESTful API for Client Interactions**: Offers API endpoints for network participation, transaction submissions, and balance inquiries.
- üí∞ **Balance Management**: Track individual account balances and total network balance.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: BlockShare is intended for local network setups and educational purposes, not for deployment on public networks. It's a valuable resource for anyone wanting a hands-on approach to learning blockchain principles and creating a small-scale cryptocurrency.


## üìã Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **C++ Compiler** (supporting C++11 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Machine with WinSock2** support for network operations


## üîß Installation

<details>
  
<summary>Step-by-step guide</summary>

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aradhya2708blockshare.git
cd blockshare
```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Compile C++ components:
```bash
# Compile main blockchain implementation
g++ blockchain.cpp -o blockchain -lws2_32

# Compile hash nonce utility
g++ hashNonce.cpp -o hashNonce
```
</details>

## üñ•Ô∏è Running a Node

1. Create ```.env``` with IP and PORT

2. Start the Node.js server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Execute the blockchain core:
```bash
./blockchain
```

4. Add peer information in ```/localdb/peers.json```

5. Modify and execute Native Miner ```/native/hashNonce.cpp```
```bash
./hashNonce
```


## üì° API Endpoints for Client

Here‚Äôs how you can interact with your local BlockShare via REST API

### ü§ù Join Network
Allow a new node to join the local network by specifying the desired port.
```bash
# say one of the nodes in the local network is running over 172.12.345.678:3000
curl -X POST http://172.12.345.678:3000/blockchain/contribute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provided_port": 8080,
  }'
```

### üí∏ Submit Transaction
Submit a transaction, including details like sender, recipient, amount, nonce, and a signature.
```bash
curl -X POST http://172.12.345.678:3000/blockchain/submit-txn \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sender": "sender_address",
    "recipient": "recipient_address",
    "amt": 100,
    "nonce": 12345,
    "sign": "transaction_signature"
  }'
```

### üí∞ Get Total Balance
Retrieve the total balance across the network.
```bash
curl http://172.12.345.678:3000/blockchain/balance
```

### üë§ Get Account Balance
Get the balance for a specific account address.
```bash
curl http://172.12.345.678:3000/blockchain/balance/0x123...abc
```

## üìä Sample Response Formats

### Balance Response
A typical balance response structure.
```json
{
  "account": "0x123...abc",
  "balance": 1000
}
```
